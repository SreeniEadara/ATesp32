# ATesp32

This is an ATmega32A replacement that uses the ESP32-S3.
Why? Because I bought ATmega32-based keyboard PCBs (the Discipline), love it and want to add wireless capabilities (BLE) and native USB.

I've made efforts to maintain the same number of GPIO, but there will be many differences you would encounter if trying to use this as an ATmega32A replacement. These would include logic levels, availability of analog pins, clock, etc.

Thank you to Adafruit for making the Feather and QtPy boards for the ESP32-S3!
I heavily referenced these in this design.

Call me an Adafruit shill if you will, but you can support open hardware by purchasing from them.
